============

PLEASE BE ADVISED!!!!!
The Files and code in this github repository have been placed here for the purposes of an online D.O.X. Training mission.
Do NOT...I say again....Do NOT take any of this code at face value.  Some of these scripts have been deliberately left
vulnerable for the sake of training. 

I would strongly advise anyone reading this who is NOT participating in the actuall challenge to NOT actually use any of
the scripts contained here.  They won't harm your computer or any files, but they will most likely NOT protect you or act
the way that they are supposed to.

Consider yourself warned.
